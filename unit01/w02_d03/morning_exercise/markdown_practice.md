## Part 1
Read the [original Markdown docs](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and then read the [GitHub Flavored Markdown docs](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). Do some research about the history of Markdown, starting with Wikipedia. Also read the [Markdown cheatsheet we made for you](./markdown_cheatsheet.md).

## Part 2
Read about Github gists [on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/).

## Part 3
Watch [this TED Talk about grit](http://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_the_key_to_success_grit?language=en).

## Part 4
Make another Markdown file called `bash_cheatsheet.md` in the `notes` directory and make yourself a cheatsheet about Bash commands. At a minimum, include the commands to:

  - create a directory
  - create a file
  - move a file
  - move a directory
  - rename a file
  - rename a directory
  - delete a file
  - delete a directory
  - move around within a directory
  - see what files and directories exist
  - check where in the directory structure you are.

Be as complete as possible and expand on this list; your cheatsheet will be a great resource for you from now on. This is another opportunity to practice Markdown, so include a table, a list (ordered or unordered), and a link.

## Part 5
Create a gist, give it a name, and change its language to Markdown. Put the following questions and your answers to the questions into the gist. Format it fully with Markdown. Create a Markdown file called `gist.md` in the `notes` directory with the link to your gist.
