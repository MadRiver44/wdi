_Timon and Pumbaa's Super Duper Pseudo-Code Introduction!_

# INTRO TO PSEUDO-CODE

**A developer solves problems | A developer is a problem solver.**  

**A developer embraces chaos | A developer makes order from chaos.**  

Learning how to solve problems is fundamental to being a developer. In order to make creative and complex apps with a variety of technologies and techniques, having strong problem-solving skills is vital.

**Pseudo-coding** is all about breaking a problem down to its logical steps. As a developer, you can be faced with a 'wall of complexity' that will lead to paralysis; sometimes the most difficult part is knowing where to start. This is why it's best to take the time to think about, verbalize, or diagram a problem BEFORE you write any actual code.

Pseudo-code is not Javascript or Ruby, etc. It is, however, written in *sequence*. Pseudo code breaks down the step-by-step thought process with short lines using basic grammar, as if an articulate ten-year old is writing it. For example, here's some pseudo code for making a lasagne:

---
> 1. Pre-heat oven to 350 deg F
> 2. Boil water for that crimpy pasta
> 3. etc . . .


Go ahead and pseudo-code the following problems with a buddy! Try to see past any convoluted language or complexity to get to the core of it:

## EXERCISES
####1. Subway
Andrew wants to go and visit a bunch of hotspots in Manhattan. He is traveling by subway and wants to know which trains to take to hit the following subway destinations (he starts out his day at Union Square):

Union Square, Lincoln Center, West 4th St, Grand Central, Roosevelt Island, Wall St 4/5.

Which trains should he take to get through his itinerary? Try and make his journey brief. (You might want to find a subway map online).

#### 2. Restaurant Tippin'
Rick, Morty, Bird Person, and Squanchy are getting dinner at a restaurant. Pseudo-code an application which can take the bill, split it amongst the four of them, and add a tip percentage of your choosing. For example a bill of $40 with a 20% tip should evaluate to $12 per person including tip.


####3. Equator
How much would it cost to drive around the world at the equator, assuming the Earth is rotating at 1000 mph, and assuming gas costs $2 per gallon, and your car gets 15 miles to the gallon.
