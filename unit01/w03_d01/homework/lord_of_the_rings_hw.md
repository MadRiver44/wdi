## Trip To MorDOMr

#### Learning Objectives

- Practice using 'jQuery' to manipulate the DOM

You've taken a trip from the shire across Middle Earth and its been so wonderful and so much fun, that you want to code your way through it one more time using jQuery.

### Step 1-13

Last week you worked on the functions that you found in the app.js file using Vanilla JS.  Tonight please implement those JavaScript functions using jQuery or feel free to solve the problems again.  You've learned SOOOOOO much in one week. Let's practice implementing it!  

**Remember** you can check your DOM tree in the Elements tab in Chrome Console.

**Workflow**

Tackle this problem one function from start to finish at a time.

Same as before, each function should depend on the previous ones, so make sure your function works before moving on to the next one!

Every time you refresh the page, you will have to click the buttons one by one
in order from the beginning to operate your application.


**Submission**
Just as every time before, submit an issue on GitHub providing a link to your hw.

**REMEMBER**

YOU ARE THE ROCK STAR!

YOU ARE LEARNING SOOOOO MUCH!

TEST YOUR LIMITS!

PUSH FURTHER!
