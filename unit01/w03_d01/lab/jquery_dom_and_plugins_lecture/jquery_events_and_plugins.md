# JQuery Events and JQuery Plugins

### Objective
- Review the Event Object
- Review the subtle implementation differences in **JQuery** and the **DOM** 
- Focus on keyboard and mouse events.
- Retrieve event data in the event object


### Prerequisite Check
	*  Do we know the EVENT object?
	*  Do we understand events in the context of the browser?

### List of most used events
- on
 - click 
 - mouseover
 - mouseout
 - toggle
 - custom events - triggers
- Events Delegation

### Event Object - candidates for discussion:
- event as a whole
- e.preventDefault
- keydown
- e.target
- e.type
- event delegation


## JQuery Event - High Level
jQuery's event system **normalizes** the event object according to W3C standards. It create a wrapper/abstraction around the dom event implementation that may vary from browser to browser. Ahem...IE...
