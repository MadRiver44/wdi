# PROJECT TOOLS

## Wireframing + Planning
You are about to jump into your first project at GA! So thrilling. This morning we wanted to review two tools that will help you tackle this endeavor in an organized, professional manner.

First, let's talk about wireframing! What the heck is it?</br>
Simply, it's a way to break down a project visually and functionally to achieve your MVP (Minimum Viable Product).

The best way to understand wireframing, it to practice it. So let's use our Hangman homework as an example and work through this together.</br>

Still confused?
<a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/wireframes-start-development-projects">Here's</a> some reading on the topic as well.

## Writing README.md
What is the README.md file?</br>
<a href="https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2">Let's</a> check it out!

Now let's practice! Make a markdown file called `README.md` in the `notes` directory for today. Using the tic tac toe homework as a prompt, write a `README.md` that includes the following information about the app:

  - Project Title
  - Screen Shot of Game
  - Technologies Used
  - Code Example
  - Build Strategy
  - Contributing
  - Complications/Future Improvements
  - Authors

We are super nice and have created a Markdown Cheatsheet for you <a href="markdown_cheatsheet.md"> here</a> to understand the markdown syntax.
