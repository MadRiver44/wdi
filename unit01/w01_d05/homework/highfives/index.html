    <h1>High Fives!</h1>

    <p>I am attempting to make an in-browser version of this console exercise.
    So far, this is the extent of my progress.
    I was able to get all of the required JS to work in the console,
    with the exception of two points:</p>
    <br>
   <ul>
      <li>
        If doubleTap is a miss, the creature is removed from the game.
        <br>
        I think this is awkward to code as requested (ie at the level of the Creature
        Constructor.) This I think is better done as a super-level function, or abstractly
        by manipulating an array of values passed in to the constructor as player name values.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bonus: On page load, give the user an option to select who they
        want to play with from a list of creatures.
        <br>
        I am able to provide a list of optional players, but I am having a difficult time
        providing a filter function to construct a player array from this select input.
        I could just call friends.acceptMember() a number of times, but that is not the way I
        want to go.
      </li>
    </ul>


    <form>
      <label for="playerName">Select player name: </label>
      <select id="playerName"></select>
      <button id="setPlayer" onclick="setPlayer1()">Select your name: </button>
      <br>
    </form>

    <div id="players"></div>

    <br>

    <button id="play" onclick="friends.anotherDay()">Attempt a High Five!</button>

    <button id="double" onclick="friends.doubleTap()">Go for a Double Tap!</button>

<div id="status"></div>
<div id="attendance"></div>


<script>

let setPlayer1 = function() {
  let sel = document.getElementById('playerName');
  let player1 = sel.value;
  playerArray = playerArray + player1;
};

let displayPlayers = function () {
    document.getElementById("players").innerHTML = players;
};
let displayHtmlAttendance = function () {
    document.getElementById("attendance").innerHTML = attendance;
};
let displayHtmlStatus = function () {
    document.getElementById("status").innerHTML = status;
};

displayPlayers();
displayHtmlAttendance();
displayHtmlStatus();

</script>
