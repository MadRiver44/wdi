# ES6 Classes

### Objectives
- Understand the what a constuctor function is and what its purpose is.
- Create a ES6 class and use it to create different objects.
- Learn how to access the constructor from and instance
- Understand inheritence in the context of JS classes.
- Greate a basic class and then extend it to create two more classes.

### Define through session
- Class:
- Instance:
- Inheritence:

### Discussion
- Factory examples in real life. How would we define a factory?
- What is DRY?
- How does having a "factory" DRY up our code?

### Code along
- Create an ES6 class and use it to create objects. What is the general anatomy of a class?
- Dig into the created objects to get a feel for what they have when created w/ a factory vs when created literally.
- Make changes to the factory and see them reflected when new objects. Are created.

### Discussion
- What if we want to create a new factory that does all of the same stuff as one that we already have?
- If we have two factories that have some similar functionality, how can we DRY that up?

### Code along
- Extend the class we just made to create a new class with additional functionality.
- Use the new class to create new objects.
- Extend the base class again to create a third class. Explore the differences between instances of the three classes?
