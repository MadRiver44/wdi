# PROJECT EULER P

##What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
The motivation for starting Project Euler is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

You can learn more about Project Euler <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">here</a>.

Now let's dive in to solving your first Euler Problem!

##EULER PROBLEM 1

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

##EULER PROBLEM 2
Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```
Find the sum of the even-valued terms up to the cut off of 2000.
