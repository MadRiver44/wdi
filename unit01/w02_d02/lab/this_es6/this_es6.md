## Lab
- Create a function that has 4 parameters that can take default values.

-  With the code block in the grey section, use a template string to produce the following string. You can create a new variable that will hold the newly create string result. 

The ID for our class 12332112321 but we go by Hakuna Matata.
We are composed of 2 cohorts, which seems like a large undertaking, but we have "no Worries" :) 

 -Cioa!

```javascript
const salutaion = 'Cioa';
const HakunaMatata = {
  id: 12332112321,
  cohorts: 2,
  displayName: 'Hakuna Matata',
  meaning: 'No worries',
  classSize: 'large',
  emoji: ':)'
}
```
- Go to [Caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/) and identify what browser **do not** support `let`

- Go to [Kangax.github.io](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/) and identify the browsers that **do not** support the **fat arrow function**

- The code below is not working as expected. Meaning it's not returning its value *"Why am I not showing up??"*. Fix the code to make it work.

```javascript
const fn1 = () => {'Why am I not showing up??'};

console.log( fn1() );
```

**BONUS - FIX it...FIX it**

Navigate to [ES6 kata](http://es6katas.org/). Click on "Default Parameter" exercise. Attempt to fix the bugs.

Try the same thing with "Block Scope and Arrow Functions"
