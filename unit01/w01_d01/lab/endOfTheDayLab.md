Look at the bright side! You've learned soooo much! Did you know yesterday about eslint? Chrome dev tools? Wow! Now you do :)


You, guys, are soooo great on doing independent work and research! I would like to provide some links for you to read during this this 45 min lab. Do your best to read and understand gitHub.io and how to host your portfolio project there. Don't worry, if you don't understand it at first (ask a classmate that succeeded? maybe?) Finally, host your aboutMe project there and share a link over Slack. If you get stuck, ask for after hours assistance from your amazing TAs..
