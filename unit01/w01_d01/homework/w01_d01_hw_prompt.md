## JavaScript!
It's time to start thinking like a developer! Tonight you are going to practice writing JavaScript variables, data types, and statements through the following problems.

### Instructions
1. Create a new **week01_d01.js** file in the current directory (unit01/week01_d01/homework).</br>
2. Copy all questions from below into newly created file and **insert** answers below each corresponding question.</br>
3. Submit your evening assignment just as you did before via a GitHub issue.</br>

Reminder!</br>
All answers must be fully functioning, so make sure to use the console or IDE (ie repl.it, codepen, etc) to verify that.

#### Subjects covered.
  - Variables
  - Data Types
  - Control Flow

#### VARIABLE PRACTICE
Create an array that contains four strings, assigning each string a value of the seasons.</br>
The array will have 4 indices, 0 through 3. :fallen_leaf:

1. Write a statement to access "Spring" and assign it to a new variable. </br>
Then reassign that variable to a boolean value based on the current season.</br>

2. Write a statement to access "Fall" and assign it to a new variable. </br>
Then reassign that variable to a boolean value based on the current season.</br>

#### DATA TYPE PRACTICE
Please write the answer (in sentence form) below each question:</br>

1. What is the difference between undefined and null?

2. What is the difference between truthy and falsey?

3. Take the variables and numbers below and replace the blanks with a mathematical or boolean operators that makes the statement console.log true.

```javascript
  var a = 4;
  var b = 53;
  var c = 57;
  var d = 16;
  var e = 'Kevin';
```

-  a __ b;
-  c __ d;
-  'Name' __ 'Name';
-  a __ b __ c;
-  a __ a __ d;
-  e __ 'Kevin';
-  48 __ '48';

#### CONTROL FLOW STATEMENTS
Let's practice the following control flow statements:

#####IF ELSE
Write a prompt for a beer buyer to input their age.</br>
If they are over 21, they are in the clear, if not, bring down the hammer.</br>
Write an **if/else** statement that would *alert* a response as to whether or not they are of age :beer:

  huh...what is prompt you say?
  hint: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt

#### SWITCH STATEMENTS
Write a **switch** JavaScript statement that prompt to ask what day is today. :date:

- If it's Monday alert "Energize!"
- If it's Tuesday alert "Just getting started!"
- If it's Wednesday alert "Hump Hump!"
- If it's Thursday alert "Almost there!"
- If it's Friday, Saturday or Sunday alert "Weeeeeee!"
- If it's not anything above alert "Huh, sorry didn't get that?"

#### YOU CHOOSE!
Let's take the Subway. Write out the JavaScript that would do the following. :station:

- When the script is run a menu should be prompted displaying:
  - A list of three trains - `The (L) Train, The (N) Train, The (S)ix Train`
  - The prompt ask the user to make their selection

    - If the user enters: `L`
      - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as L train
      - A console log output should contain the following:
        - `8th Ave`
        - `6th Ave`
        - `Union Square`
        - `3rd Ave`
        - `1st Ave`
        - `Bedford Ave`
    - If the user enters: `N`
      - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as N train
      - A console log output should contain the following:
        - `Times Square`
        - `Herald Square`
        - `28th St`
        - `23rd St - DAPS Nexus`
        - `Union Square`
        - `8th St `
    - If the user enters `S`
      - An alert should output a message containing the user's selection labeled as S train
      - A console log output should contain the following:
        - `Grand Central`
        - `33rd St`
        - `28th St`
        - `23rd St`
        - `Union Square`
        - `Astor Place`

- Then a thank You message should alert.
- The program then exits.
