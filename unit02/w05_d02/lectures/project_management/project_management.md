# Project Management Workflow

**Objectives**
- Create a wireframe outlining the simplest core functionality of a familiar web app.
- Use the wireframe to create user stories outlining the required functionality for our wireframe. Define acceptance criteria for each user story so that the features can be developed and tested.
- Create a wireframe from a concise product description and then create user story cards from those wireframes (lab).

**Definitions**
- *Wireframe*: an image or set of images which displays the functional elements of a website or page, typically used for planning a site's structure and functionality.
- *User Story*: a user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.
- *Backlog*: the agile product backlog in Scrum is a prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product.

### Exercise 1: To Do App
**Product Description**
> The **To Do List** app is a single page application. The application consists of a list section which presents the to do items. There is also an input field for adding new to do items.
>
> A user can type text into the input field and click the "Add" button. When the button is clicked, the input field is cleared and the item is added to the list.
>
> The to do items list is numbered and each row has an "Edit" and a "Complete" button. When the edit button is pressed, the static is replaced by an input field pre-populated with the todo text. The "Edit" and "Complete" buttons are replaced by a "Save" button.
>
> When the "Save" button is clicked, the input is replaced by static text displaying the new todo.
>
> When the complete button is clicked, the to do item is removed from the list.
