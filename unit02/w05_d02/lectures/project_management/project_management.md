# Project Management Workflow

**Objectives**
- Create a wireframe outlining the simplest core functionality of a familiar web app.
- Use the wireframe to create user stories outlining the required functionality for our wireframe. Define acceptance criteria for each user story so that the features can be developed and tested.
- Create a wireframe from a concise product description and then create user story cards from those wireframes (lab).

**Definitions**
- *Wireframe*: an image or set of images which displays the functional elements of a website or page, typically used for planning a site's structure and functionality.
- *User Story*: a user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.
- *Backlog*: the agile product backlog in Scrum is a prioritized features list, containing short descriptions of all functionality desired in the product.
