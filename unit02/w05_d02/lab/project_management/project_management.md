# Apartment Listing App - Wireframes & User Stories
In this lab we will practice creating wireframes and user stories to plan and organize development tasks given a short description of a product.

**Product Description**
> **Apartment Lister** is a simple [CRUD app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) where users can view apartment listings.
> 
> When a user first visits the site, they land on the *apartments index page* - the page which displays all of the apartment listings records with their image, title and short description.
>
> A user clicks on one of listings on the index page to visit the *show page* for that apartment listing. A record's show page shows all of the information for that listing (title, image, long description, address, agent contact info, etc.)
> 
> A user can click the edit button the the show page of a listing to visit the edit form. They edit form is pre-populated with the listings data. The user can change the data, click save, and is then redirected to the listings show page which displays the new data for the listing.
> 
> From the listings index page, a user can click the "Create Listing" button and is redirected to the *new listing page*. This page is similar to the *edit listing* page except the form is not pre-populated. User can click save and is redirected to the show page for the newly created listing.

**Instructions**
1. With your partner, create wireframes outlining all of the major states required for this application to work. (30 minutes)
2. Find another pair and switch wireframes with them. With your partner, create user story cards based on the wireframe you received. Be sure to add enough acceptance criteria to each card for a developer to start work on this application. (30 minutes)
