#Lab
**Prerequisite**: Make sure you have create-react-app installed globally.

`npm install -g create-react-app`

In the `react_lab_recipes` folder you will find the following files/folder:

- public (Folder)
	- index.html
	- media (Folder)
		- tikka.jpg	
-	src (folder)
	- index.js
	- components (folder)
		- App.js 
- package.json
- json (For Bonus)
	- recipe.json (For Bonus)

1. Open terminal
2. cd into `react_lab_recipes`
3. run `npm install`. This will install the modules to use create-react-app.
4. Once all dependencies are installed, run `npm start`. This should take you to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

##Your Task
Analyze the recipe(index.html) page and identify items that can be made into React components.

####Tips
- Create js files in the components
- Use props where necessary
- Everything can be deemed a component

Once page is completed, please upload to your preferred environment (github pages, now, firebase, etc)


###Bonus
Try to have your data come from a json file. You can find a folder called `json` that has a `recipe.json`
