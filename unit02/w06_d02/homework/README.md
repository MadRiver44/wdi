### TWEEDR REDO
![Tweedr](tweedr_two.png)

Let's beef up your **Tweedr** app, making it fully **CRUD** using *React*, *Firebase*, and *Axios* to make requests to the database!

### Step I: Mock Up

Using the new mock up above, edit your Trello user stories and developer tasks to reflect full CRUD functionality.

### Step II: Set Up Firebase

You can use the **same** Firebase database you set up yesterday! Refer to the original Tweedr README if you have any questions.

### Step III: Deliverables
Your **new and improved** Tweedr Application should:

1. Take an input of a Tweed.

2. Render all of the Tweeds from the database into the browser.

3. Be able to edit and delete the Tweeds individually.

4. Accomplish the above by making 4 API calls following **RESTful** format:

  `POST` (Posts a new Tweed to your db)

  `GET` (Gets all of the Tweeds from your db and renders them on the screen)

  `PATCH`(Edits a Tweed in the browser and have those changes reflected in the db)

  `DELETE` (Deletes a Tweed in your browser and db)

5. Complete the Tweedr app, with **FOUR** components:

  `App` (Will hold all the database calls)

  `Input` (Will take a text input and `POST` to database through props passed down from `App`)

  `TweedrFeed` (Will `GET` all of the Tweeds and render a bunch of `Tweed` components)

  `Tweed` (Will be `PATCH`-able and `DELETE`-able)

### Submission:
Submit an issue ticket with your:
  - Github repo link (With a **TON** of git commits!)
  - Link to a deployed version
  - Your name in the title



  ### OOOHHHH! Completely forgot!
  Because we are super nice, [HERE](./axios_cheatsheet.md) is the cheatsheet to support your REST journey.

## Bonus!
Drop the mic on that hw? Try a new styling framework to make Tweedr look gooood.

Styled the heck out of it? Use the time to go over old homeworks/lectures/labs to review.
