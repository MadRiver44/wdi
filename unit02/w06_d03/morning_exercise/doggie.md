# Skeleton CSS

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/p68Hk9u2hRSoM/giphy.gif)

We are going to practice html and css by building this handsome, well-dressed dog a new website, using CSS library, [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), to achieve this!

## Set Up

PARTNER UP!

Just like with pseudocoding, spend five to ten minutes planning out the HTML and CSS.

One person should WIREFRAME the webpage. Draw boxes around elements to get a sense of which elements should be nested and  where elements belong in the HTML.

The other person should review the [BootStrap Documentation](http://getbootstrap.com/) - what elements and classes do you need to create a grid system. What kind of classes affect default styles of elements like buttons?

After five minutes, come together and plan to figure out which elements you need and how to incorporate BootStrap!

Work in the starter `index.html` and `style.css` files. You will find the images in the img folder.

## Deliverables!

Recreate the mockup below using BootStrap CSS and team power!

Keep the following in mind while using BootStrap:

- What are the different aspects of this mockup? What are the largest elements/collections of elements you see?
- What elements appear to be nested within each other?
- Do any elements seem to have non-default styling? Checkout the docs for BootStrap default styling.
- Is there anything in the starter code that might give you access to more style values?

You got this!
