# React Weather App Feature Implementation

Congratulations, your weather app works! Here is a list of new features we'd like you to implement:

- Instead of loading the app without any data, fetch the data for the zipcode 90210 and display it when the app loads. Hint: this data fetching has to be done in one of the lifecycle methods.

- Refactor the WeatherApp component and break it into a SearchBar component and a Display component.

- If the current temperature is below 32 degrees, set the color of the temperature font to blue. If it's above 90 degrees, set it to red. Leave it black otherwise.

- Style the app however you'd like as long as it's responsive. Experiment with bootstrap or another css framework if you have time.
