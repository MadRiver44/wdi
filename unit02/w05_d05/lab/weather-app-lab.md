# React Weather App Feature Implementation

Congratulations, your weather app works! Here is a list of new features we'd like you to implement:

- Instead of loading the app without any data, fetch the data for the zipcode 90210 and display it when the app loads. Hint: this data fetching has to be done in one of the lifecycle methods.

- Add a select element that contains 10 zip codes. When one of the zip codes is selected, update the weather data display. Come up with a quick wireframe before you begin coding.

- If the current temperature is below 32 degrees, set the color of the temperature font to blue. If it's above 90 degrees, set it to red. Leave it black otherwise.

- Style the app however you'd like as long as it's responsive. Experiment with bootstrap or another css framework if you have time.
