Let's take the morning to have a little fun, while we learn about a handy dandy CSS tool called **flexbox**!

## Flexbox
CSS3 Flexbox (aka Flexible Box) is a layout mode which helps make elements behave more predictably when you're developing a page that must accommodate different screen sizes/devices.

As an alternative to the block model, developers dig it because it does not use floats. They also dig it because    the flex layout has the ability to alter its items' width and/or height to best fit in the available space on any display device. A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
