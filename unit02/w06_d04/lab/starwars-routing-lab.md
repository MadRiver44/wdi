## React Star Wars feed, with routing

For this lab you will add another route and another component.

- `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
- The new route should be `/contact`
- The contact component should just have some basic info about contacting the owner of the website
- After adding the component, add a link to the component in the header next to our other links
- After adding the link, add a `<Match />` component that will match that route

The final product should be the same as the app from the lecture with an additional link in the header to a new contatc component that you've created.
