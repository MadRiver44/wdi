// IA's will walk through the creation of the snowman_spec file

//I want my snowman builder to create a snowman object
//My winter wonderland is a friendly place, so I want each snowman to have a name
//In order for it to really be a snowman, it needs to have some fatures:
//-a carrot nose.
//-stick arms.
//Our snowman should like warm hugs.
