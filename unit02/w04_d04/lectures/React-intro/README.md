# React

## The need for libraries/frameworks

- As your web app grows the need for strict code organization grows with it. Otherwise, you end up with spaghetti code!

## The ubiquity of React

- Everybody uses React... it's being adopted by many companies including Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Netflix, Walmart, etc. Even other frameworks are incorporating many of its concepts and ideas.
- It can be used everywhere. React Native allows you to transer your web dev skills to Android and iOS app development.

## React - a user interface library

- At the core of React are Components, which you can think of as pieces of an user interface. There are lots of moving parts to components but they all have at least a render method that returns a React element.
- React elements are immutable JavaScript objects. React utilizes its "Virtual DOM" to update the browser DOM much faster than normal.

## Thinking in React - Components

- The first step to thinking in React is to see websites as collections of components. One simple example is a blog. A blog might have a PostList component, a Post component, a CommentList component, a Comment component, and on.
- Each of these components are reusable, composable, and efficient. As we'll see as we move deeper into React, building user interfaces in this manner makes data fetching, handling, and mutating more straightforward.
