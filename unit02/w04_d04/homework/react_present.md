Now that you've begun to learn React, it's time to dig deep! As a holiday present from GA, everyone has been gifted the Wes Bos [React for Beginners Course](https://reactforbeginners.com/)!

### Who is Wes Bos?
Wes Bos is a Full Stack Canadian Developer, who has taught over 500 students in 200+ classes, plus thousands of developers through online courses/videos. He knows his stuff and he knows how to set developers up for success.

### What is the React for Beginners Course?
It's a fantastic resource that Wes Bos put together for React newbees, which teaches you, through video and corresponding exercises, what React is about.

### How do I get started!

Here's the step process to getting you signed up and set up for the course:

1. You'll receive an email invite to join the React Course (most likely, after Christmas).

2. Sign up!

3. Once logged in, click on the **Starter Files** link beneath the React course description. This will take you to the Course Github Repo.

4. **Fork** the **React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files** repo, so that you have a copy of the starter files in your GitHub account.

4. Now go to your Github and go through the process of git cloning your forked copy, so that it is local to your computer. Please clone the repo inside the `general_assembly` folder on your computer, but outside the `WDI_HAKUNA_MATATA` and `project` folders.

5. You have set up the playground to work in! Niiiiiiice.

6. Now go back to the Wes Bos React Course in the browser and you'll see the option to stream the course videos or download them. You pick!

7. From there, you are set to begin! Just follow the videos and Wes's guidance to tackle the course from start to finish.

##### Bonus!
Join the course slack channel to get help from Developers around the world as you tackle this course step by step!

### HW Expectations
We expect the following to be completed during break:

1. Complete the Wes Bos React for Beginners Course making sure to:
  - **Git Commit** your work after every video and push the commits to your Github.
  - The entire course must be completed by **10p on Monday January 2nd**. Submit via issue ticket linking to your forked West Bos course repo and all the work you've done.

2. Read the [React Docs Quickstart](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html) and go through the [React tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/hello-world.html). You do not need to include this in the issue ticket, but you DO need to complete it.
