### Arrays

Starting with the following array...

```rb
planeteers = ["Earth", "Wind", "Captain Planet", "Fire", "Water"]
```

Access the second value in `planeteers`.

```rb
# Your answer here planeteers[1]
```

Add "Heart" to the end of `planeteers`.

```rb
# Your answer here planeteers.push("Heart")
```

Remove "Captain Planet" from the array.

```rb
# Your answer here planeteers - ["Captain Planet"]
```

Combine `planeteers` with `rangers = ["Red", "Blue", "Pink", "Yellow", "Black"]` and save the result in a variable called `heroes`.

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Alphabetize the contents of `heroes` using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Randomize the contents of `heroes` using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
```

#### Bonus

Select a random element from `heroes` using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Select all elements in `heroes` that begin with "B" using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
```

### Hashes

Initialize a hash called `ninja_turtle` with the properties `name`, `weapon` and `radical`. They should have values of "Michelangelo", "Nunchuks" and `true` respectively.

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Add a key `age` to `ninja_turtle`. Set it to whatever numerical value you'd like.

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Remove the `radical` key-value pair from `ninja_turtle`.

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Add a key `pizza_toppings` to `ninja_turtle`. Set it to an array of strings (e.g., `["cheese", "pepperoni", "peppers"]`).

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Access the first element of `pizza_toppings`.

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Produce an array containing all of `ninja_turtle`'s keys using a method. [The Ruby documentation might help](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html).

```rb
# Your answer here
```

Using .map and .each, mutate the arrays below:

```ruby
# Add 1 to each number in the array

arr1 = [1,2,3]

#map
# put your code here
```
#each
# put your code here
```

```ruby
# Mutate the array 2x using .map and .each. 
# The first time convert all names to uppercase.
# The second just the first character of each name. 

names = [paris,vincent,patrick,joe]
# put your code here
```

#### BONUS #1 
Put your algorithm skills to the test and use Ruby to reverse a string.  Of course your initial thought is to use reverse so give that a try but that won't get you any props on  a whiteboarding interview, SO...try solving it without using reverse.  

Using an array and it's each method, reverse a string, eg 'apple' => 'elppa'

```rb
input = 'apple'
# put your code here
```
