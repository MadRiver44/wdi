# Socket.IO Chat app!

`npm install --save socket.io`

### Core concepts

Web sockets enable clients and servers to establish a persistent connection. Without web sockets, a client might have to set up a timer and poll a server every second for updates. With web sockets, the server can emit events to the client whenever there is a particular update. The two important concepts for web sockets and in socket.io are `event emitters` and `event listeners`.

Check out the following tutorial on events in node.js in general: [node.js events documentation](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-nodes-event-module--net-35941)

#### Socket.IO simple example

Check out the socket.io-colors example. It is a very simple example of using sockets to emit events from both the client and server and how to respond to events.

### Socket.IO Lab

This is unit 4, read the documentation: [amazing socket.io documentation](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

If you want to challenge yourself or really take in sockets and socket.io, do the homework in that tutorial.
