# It's Sweet Libs Time!
![Bill Murray](http://www.mememaker.net/static/images/memes/4044450.jpg)

Sweet libs is an opportunity to test your ability to pick up new technology without someone walking you through it!

Practice the skill you're likely to use the most in the Industry: **Teaching Yourself Something New.**

## Expectations
Today you and your **Accountability Buddy**, will choose a technology you are curious about and be responsible for:
* Reading the docs and understanding what the technology does
* Writing a **Getting Started Tutorial** ReadMe of your Technology on Github(see details below)

## ReadMe
Each groups **Getting Started Tutorial** should:

  - Be written in markdown and pushed to a Github Repo (One Repo that you BOTH contribute to)
  - Include step by step installation guide, screen shots, gifs, diagrams, code snippets, and any other tools that will help make the guide as useful as possible. *Do NOT follow [DTROTFO](https://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg) methodology.*
  - Note dependencies and similarities/differences to other types of tech we've studied.
  - Think about what assumed knowledge is in the official docs, and unassume it. Fill in the missing pieces and make your ReadMe more approachable for WDI students.

## Submission

**By the end of the day today** submit your tutorial README via Github issue.
*NOTE*: Submit ONE issue listing 2 names of contributors in the title.
