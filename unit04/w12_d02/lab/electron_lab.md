#Electron Lab

## Part 1

[Follow the instruction for the quick start: https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start] (https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) 

## Part 2
The Goal of this exercise is to get you comfortable with the idea of **developing** and **distributing** a desktop application using Electron.

Build the most basic application and package it for distribution. You will place the app in your own github account, where someone can do a git clone, and double click your executable. Use the **[Electron Quick Start](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/)** as your starter file(s). Also use the **electron-iss example** as a guiding light.

Also feel free to use third-party libraries, modules, etc. There are no constraints. But if things get challenging...scale back.

**Couple of App Ideas:**

- A Simple Hello World/You üòÄ
- a Clock/Timer that refreshes every second (think setinterval) 12:45, 12:46...üïê
- Perhaps port over your first game project ü§î
- A Stock Market Monitor

#Bonus
