# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: C.R.U.D.

### Overview

* A VAST majority of the internet is based on C.R.U.D.  
* Now it's your turn to apply your own interests to a C.R.U.D. application with a React based Front-End.
* MAKE IT LOOK GOOD!  Spend the **TIME** to style your application.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Application must allow for FULL C.R.U.D. of a Firebase database**
* Use **[AXIOS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) only** to make all RESTful requests.
* Use **[REACT](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html) JS** for managing your view layer (Minimum **TWO** components, **NOT** including App.js)
* Use **FIREBASE** for storing your data
* Use **[CREATE-REACT-APP](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)** to build out your file structure
* **Deploy your website online**, where the rest of the world can access it.
* Show effort in **styling**, including **[FLEXBOX](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)** (Bonus for using **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)**)

### Necessary Deliverables

* **DUE FRIDAY MORNING:** A **[wireframe](http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/3-information-architecture/4-presenting-information.html)** of the application and a **brief description** of your **MVP**
* A **Trello board** reflecting your [userstories](http://www.mariaemerson.com/user-stories/) and developer tasks.
* A **working application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working application** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted app, and frequent commits **(After each COMPLETED task)** dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, images of your wireframes, planning phase explanation, etc.

---

### Suggested Next Steps
* What is your **MVP** and what is your **predicted timeline** to accomplish that (Suggestion: write a high level timeline to pace yourself)?
* Once you reach your MVP, what are some bonuses that want to tackle?
* Could you download a large dataset and use it somehow?  NYC Open Data?
* Could there be more than one full resource C.R.U.D. application?  For example, could someone write a Haiku... and then others comments on it?

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Recipes
- Allow a user to manage their personal recipes!

##### Itinerary Application
- Allows a user to manage itineraries with lists of things to do

##### Weather Advisor
- Add location to a database
- The application can then, using a weather api, inform you of ALL the weathers

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, and task tracking as specified above? Did you include a README with a planning process.

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

|Score | Expectations |
|----- |:------------:|
|**0** |  Incomplete. |
|**1** | Does not meet expectations.|
|**2** | Meets expectations, good job!|
|**3** | Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!|

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
