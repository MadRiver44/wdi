As we head into this last unit, it's vital that you rely on one another, not only for coding hurdles, but to **hold each other accountable for your goals**.

To help to aid in this, we've paired you together (based on yesterdays exit ticket), so you have an anchor to help ground you in completing all Unit 4 Projects **(A graduation requirement)**.

Some ideas for holding one another accountable:
* Daily Stand Ups (Either in person, remote, or on Slack)
* Create wireframes for each app and walk your buddy through the proposed functionality.
* Create a timeline and due dates for each application.
* Review each others code, giving constructive feedback.
* Go grab lunch to blow of steam and bounce ideas off of each other

**Remember, code family forever!**
