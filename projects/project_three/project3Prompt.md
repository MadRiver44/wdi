### Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups for various labs and exercises, but this time we’re going to challenge you to **work on a WHOLE project with a small team.**

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It’s a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely what you’re going to find yourself doing in your first development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

For the **Group Breakdown and Expectations**, please refer to this additional **[README](./project3Groups.md)**.

For **Technical Expectations** see requirements **below**.

Make it work, and make it awesome.

### Sprint Length: 5 days

Class time for Group Projects will begin **Friday 2.3** and end **Tuesday 2.7**. With the grand finale of presentations on Wednesday 2.8!

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) & [Express](http://expressjs.com/)** to build full stack web app
* **Should include TWO related models**, one of the which should be a user model.
* Include **all major CRUD functions** for at least one of those models
* **Add an Authentication layer to your app** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Craft thoughtful user stories together** as a team, displaying them on a **TRELLO BOARD**
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using the **[Git workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)**
* Layout and style your front-end, so that is **Responsive** and uses a **CSS Framework**
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible


---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **Functioning Full Stack Application, built by the whole team**, hosted on **[Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)**
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **team git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

---

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your code review with instructors, after you've completed the project.)_

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
**3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
