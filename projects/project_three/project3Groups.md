## Team Bonding/Project Prep

It's important to take time to fuse as a team. To get you started, please tackle the following, by **End of Day Wednesday 2/1**.

**PLEASE NOTE:** All of the steps below are **MANDATORY**

### Why are you Here?

Take time for each person to talk about their background, what drew them to code, and why they are here.

### Review Project Two

Have each person go to their Project Two Github Repo and walk the other team members through their code. Make sure to touch on the following:

- Your biggest win and the journey to get there.
- Your greatest struggle and what you learned.
- Your overall strengths and weaknesses as a developer.

*Remember* - Being able to explain your code, is as important as being able to code. This is great practice, so take it seriously!

### Project Three Brainstorm

After looking at the Project Three prompt, as a group, brainstorm project ideas that fit the technical requirements. Remember, there's no bad idea in brainstorming, so be open to possibilities.

Once you have a couple ideas, select the one that fits the project perimeters the best, and that you will be most passionate about!

## UX/UI Collaboration

On **Thursday Morning 2/2**, we are going to partner with GA UXDI students/grads to walk through their process! This is incredibly exciting because you'll be able to expand your network and gain insight into how important UX/UI is in the development process.

To prep for this collaboration, please have the following materials ready by **Thursday 2/2 at 9a**:

### Specific Problem Statement

A Problem Statement is an incredible tool to help your team flush out the purpose of your app. You ask yourself the question, "What problem is this app is trying to solve?" and then work through answering it.

Here are some links to help you explore this concept:
* [Resource One](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8ne6pfIPfixclFCcXo2OU5mWTg/view)
* [Resource Two](https://medium.com/@MattPLavoie/what-s-your-problem-e45b31bf08dd#.8ttirzxem)
* [Resource Three](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_HAKUNA_MATATA/blob/master/projects/project_three/UXD_problem_statement_worksheet.key)

Below is a template to help you format your problem statement:

**[Our service/product] was designed to achieve [goals]. We have observed that the service/product isnâ€™t meeting [these goals], which is causing [this adverse effect] to our business. How might we improve [service/product] so that our customers are more successful based on [these measurable criteria]?**

### Rough App Outline

Based on the idea that you have, create a rough draft of your application (pen and paper). This will be given to the UX/UI folks to jump start the process, since time is precious in this collaboration. **[Here's](./rough-app-draft.jpg)** an example for your reference.

*Please Note* - In the industry, you will not be the ones creating the design of an application. This outline is for the purposes of learning and to appreciate how other positions contribute to an entire process.

## Project Management/Workflow (Post UX/UI Collaboration)
During this project, you will be using the **[Agile Style of Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)** to work as a team. This includes the following:

### Wireframing

You know the drill! Once you have an idea, wireframe that design, so you fully understand the user experience and how you'll tackle that from a coding perspective as a team.
**REMINDER** It is an absolute requirement! :fire: :fire: :fire:

### Trello

Now that you've got your wireframe, breakdown the userstories and the associated developer tasks. Once this is completed, assign different tasks to each team member to complete.

### Project Github Repo

You'll be working on one Github Repo throughout this entire project. To accomplish this, you will be taught **[the Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)**, which includes:

1. Working on separate Git branches, so that no team member is working directly on the main branch of your repository.
2. How to create a Pull Request once you have a completed a task and getting approval from other team members before merging your branch.
3. Once a Pull Request is approved, how to merge your branch to the main branch and deal with merge conflicts as a team.

### Stand Up

**Each morning**, you will complete stand up, so that you understand where your team mates are at and how you can help one another on road blocks. In the stand up, quickly recap:
  - What you did yesterday.
  - Your hurdles.
  - What you plan on doing today.
  - Do you need help?

**NOTE** The instructors will *randomly* join you as an observer. Your team should be able to facilitate and elect a project manager, as well as "Git Tzar" who will host the project repo under their account.
*Remember* - Stand ups, truly mean, STAND UP! By standing you keep your recap brief, so you can get to coding.

## Project Wrap Up

### Project Submission & Project Presentations

Your project must be submitted via Github Issue on **Tuesday 2/7 by 10p.** Please, include names of the contributors in the issue. You will then **PRESENT** your project as a team on **Wednesday 2/8**, reviewing your apps functionality and the code you tackled to achieve it.

#### Group Retrospective

Working on a team requires respect, patience, constructive honesty, and kindness. These traits are vital to a successful experience.

At the end of your presentations, you will complete a **[Agile Retrospective](https://dzone.com/articles/%E2%80%9C-4-questions%E2%80%9D-retrospective)** to recap on what you did well, what you could have done better, and what you would do in the future.

## The Instructors Role

Since the groups for project3 consist of mixed of people from different squads, the ILs and IAs will be working with each group fluidly. We will be doing this by:

1. Completing Project Approval(exact process TBD)
2. Randomly jumping into stand ups *if needed* (on school days)
3. Reviewing your Github/Trello Boards for proper workflow management.
4. Providing feedback on your project submission(exact process TBD)

Please complete the following, so we can have a birds eye view of your project.

1. Share your Github Repo with all of the instructors. Below are each of their github usernames: </br>
  *  Ariana (arianadziedzic)
  *  Joe (jkeohan)
  *  Kate (shishkina)
  *  Paris (parisyee)
  *  Patrick (patrickandre)
  *  Vince (thoughtbyte)

2. Make sure your Trello Board is set to public. This way we all can review it when necessary.

3. If you run into a code issue, please complete an Issue Ticket in your Project Repo and tag any IL/IA for help.

### You got this!

Remember, that this is a learning experience! Be kind, be generous, and stay calm. This is going to be great!
