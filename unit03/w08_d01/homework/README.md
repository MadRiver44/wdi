# MONDAY FUNDAY!

You all are off to a great start! Tonight we will be reinforcing your PSQL and Express/Node.js knowledge with another round of mini exercises. Let's jump in!

## Express

### Reps on Reps on Reps

1. In your `homework` folder, create a new folder called `express_pizza_practice` to work in.

2. Using Patrick's bird themed lab on Express Routing, **RETYPE** the lecture, but change up the theme to **PIZZA**. While rebuilding remember to set up your environment:
  - `npm init` to get your `package.json`
  - `install/save npm packages` (aka dependencies) you will be using
  - set up your `npm start` (with node or nodemon)
  - set up the appropriate file structure

3. Then **add THOROUGH comments** to explain what **EACH line** of code is doing. **DO NOT** copy and paste. Seriously, you are only hurting yourselves.

4. **BONUS!**: Deploy your work to Heroku using the tutorial from this weekend (**TIP** - Move your `express_pizza_practice` folder to the root of your `general assembly` folder, so you are outside the Hakuna Matata Repo).

### Required Reading

## PSQL


### Lab Completion

Remember Paris's movie_db lab today?</br> **Complete all of the queries listed at the bottom.**

This is also a great opportunity to drop the database and start from scratch to understand the full cycle and get your reps in ðŸ’ª . So if you finish early, we would highly suggest this.

### SQL Zoo

Complete these `JOIN` exercises on [SQL Zoo](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/More_JOIN_operations). You got this!

## Submission:
Submit an issue ticket with your:
  - A Link to your Github Hakuna Matata HW Repo
  - Your **FULL** name in the title
  - *Optional* - The link to your deployed Heroku app
