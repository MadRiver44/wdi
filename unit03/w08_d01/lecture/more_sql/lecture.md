# SQL: Part 3 - Aggregate functions and joining multiple tables to explore many to many relationships.

### Objectives
- Learn about aggregate functions (`SUM` and `COUNT`) and the `GROUP BY` clause.
- Practice querying with aggregate functions.
- Revisit joining between two tables.
- Learn how to join between more more than two tables.
- Explore a many to many relationship by joining through three or more tables.

## Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY

[w3school reference](http://www.w3schools.com/Sql/sql_functions.asp) on
aggregate functions.

**[COUNT](http://www.w3schools.com/Sql/sql_func_count.asp)** - The COUNT()
function returns the number of rows that matches a specified criteria.

**[SUM](http://www.w3schools.com/Sql/sql_func_sum.asp)** - The SUM() function
returns the total sum of a numeric column.

**[GROUP BY](http://www.w3schools.com/Sql/sql_groupby.asp)** - The GROUP BY
statement is used in conjunction with the aggregate functions to group the
result-set by one or more columns.

### Exercise

Complete this [SQL ZOO](http://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SUM_and_COUNT) quiz on the `SUM`
and `COUNT` aggregate functions. After, we will review the answers as a class.
