## Express Build: Round II

From Paris's lecture today, you'll **keep building the app** you started in class.

Remember, it's okay to feel lost! You are fusing a lot of concepts into one application, so keep taking it step by step and **COMMENT** the heck out of your code!

**BONUS!**: Deploy your work to Heroku (**REMEMBER** - Move your application folder outside of the `Hakuna Matata` to deploy Repo).
