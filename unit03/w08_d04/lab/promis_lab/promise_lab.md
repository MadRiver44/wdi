# Promises Lab

### ðŸ”¥  ðŸ”¥ Flatten the Pyramid ðŸ”¥  ðŸ”¥ 
 The goal is to refactor the code below to use promises. You have a couple of options that should be research and explored. For example Googling how to ***promisify*** a callback hell. Also Google, "***chaining promises***". The libraries that can be utilized are [Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q), [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird), or the [native Promise library](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that comes with node and the browser. Don't feel limited to use these recommended libraries, if you find something that resonates with you.
 
 **Note**: Make sure to use a catch statement, so exceptions can be caught.
