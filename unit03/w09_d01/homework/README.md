## Portfolio Build with Sass & Heroku

Tonight you will spend time exploring **Sass** and **Heroku**, by rebuilding your portfolio website!

#### Requirements

  * Include a Landing Page.
  * Include Basic Routes (About, Projects, Contact)
  * Set environmental variables (we know that there is not much you can set for portfolio, use your imagination for the sake of practicing)
  * Style with SASS

#### Getting Started

1. In github, make a **NEW Repo** named `yourname_portfolio`.

2. **Git Clone** that repo in your terminal (outside of the Hakuna Matata folder), so that you have a local version to work with.

3. Set up your **File Structure/Heroku Environment**, based on Patrick's lecture/lab from today.

4. Use **Sass CSS** to make it look beautiful!

5. **Deploy your work to Heroku!**

#### Bonus!

Have you bought a domain name for your portfolio website! Check out **[Google Domains](https://domains.google/#/)** or **[Go Daddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)** or **[NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)** or just Google around :smiley: to see what domains are available. üëç
